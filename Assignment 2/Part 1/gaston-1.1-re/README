This code implements GASTON, a frequent subGrAph, Sequences and Tree ExtractiON
algorithm for general graph databases.

USAGE
-----
The input is as follows:

(line of comment in the format: # (comment))
(transaction header in the format: t (comment))
(nodes and labels for each of the nodes in the format: v (node id) (label number))
(edges in the format: e (source node id) (target node id) (label number))

...

An example is:

# start
t # 1        (transactionid is 1)
v 0 1        (label of node 1 is 1)
v 1 2        (label of node 2 is 2)
e 0 1 3      (edge from node 1 to node 2, with label 3)

To run the algorithm, first type

make

and then

gaston (support) (input file)

or 

gaston (support) (input file) (output file)

if an output file is specified all frequent graphs will be written in the 
output file. The output file has the same format as the input file,
except that before each frequent graph a comment is added which 
gives the support of the graph in the original database, as an example:

# 4
t # 1        (transactionid is 1)
v 0 1        (label of node 1 is 1)
v 1 2        (label of node 2 is 2)
e 0 1 3      (edge from node 1 to node 2, with label 3)

This would mean that the corresponding graph occurs in 4 graphs in
the original database.

As an example file Chemical_340 is provided. To run Gaston on this file,
type:

gaston 7 Chemical_340

or

gaston 7 Chemical_340 Chemical_340.out


COMMAND LINE OPTIONS
--------------------
-m i: specify that the largest frequent pattern to be examined has i nodes
-t:   only output frequent paths and trees, no cyclic graphs
-p:   only output frequent paths, no trees and cyclic graphs

KNOWN ISSUES
------------
Gaston uses anotations in the database to speed up the frequent graph
discovery process. By default these anotations are 32 bit, and the longest
frequent pattern that can be found by the default implementation contains
32 edges. To allow for longer patterns, one option is to modify the definition
of PATMASKTYPE in misc.h. Use unsigned long long for patterns of maximally
64 edges. For larger patterns further modifications would be required, but
probably frequent graph mining is not feasible in such situations. For small
datasets consider the occurrence list version of Gaston. Gaston (Occurrence Lists)
is considerably faster, but at the other hand requires exponentially more main 
memory.
